# 🌐 Mini Web Server (PBL Project #2)

A lightweight **Node.js web server** built entirely from scratch using core modules — **no Express or frameworks**.  
This project serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS) directly through HTTP requests, replicating the behavior of a real web server like Apache or Nginx.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To understand **how browsers and servers communicate** and how static files like HTML, CSS, and JS are served when you open a webpage — without relying on Live Server or Express.js.
